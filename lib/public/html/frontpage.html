    <p> Welcome to this mapping test application for my music technology project.
      The purpose of this site is to aquire information regarding the spatialisation
      of sound under four different data to audio mappings. In short; four different ways
      of transfering (x, y) information into audio output.
    </div>
    <br>
    </br>
    <h3> Outline: </h3>
    <p>On the proceeding page is a canvas object that will generate sound when
    you <b>click and drag</b> within it.</p>
    <p> The sound generated will depend upon the selected mapping, which can be changed using
      the <select><option value="1"> Mapping</option></select> dropdown. </p>
    <p> Your goal is to listen to the sound produced by clicking the <button> Play </button>,
      then approximate the path used to generate that sound. </p>
      <p><b>For example: </b> A straight
    line from left to right on a spatialisation mapping (2) will produce a steady frequency panning
  from left to right. </p>
  <p> Once you have identified and drawn the path produced within the audio playback, use the
    <button> Submit </button> to submit your approximation. </p>
    <p> Please try to submit as many paths as you can on as many mappings as possible, although
      any usage or feedback is appreciated. </p>
    <p> When you are ready to begin, tick the box below and press continue. </p>
